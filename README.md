Natural Scene Classification
=================================

Supervised natural scenes classification using hybrid image descriptor (Gabor GIST + CENTRIST + Color Histogram)

RIT. Advanced Computer Vision course

Project aimed to obtain high accuracy of scene classification through creating an advanced feature vectors based on multiple feature sets extracted using Gabor filters, CENTRIST and color histograms descriptors. The goal is to produce feature vectors that describe the scene as accurately as possible. MLP neural network was used as a classifier.
Results of the project: 95% classification accuracy with hybrid feature vector on the given testing set (150 images)
